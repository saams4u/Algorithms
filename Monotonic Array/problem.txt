Monotonic Array -> https://algoexpert.io/questions/Monotonic%20Array

Write a function takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean 
representing whether the array is monotonic.

An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are
entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing.


    Sample Input:

    array = [-1, -5, -10, -1100, -1100, -1101, -1102, -9001]

    Sample Output:
    
    true
