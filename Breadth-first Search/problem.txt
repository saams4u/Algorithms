Breadth-first Search -> https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Breadth-first%20Search

You are given a Node class that has a name and an array of optional children Nodes. 
When put together, Nodes form a simple tree-like structure. 

Implement the breadthFirstSearch method on the Node class, which takes in an empty 
array, traverse the tree using the Breadth-first Search approach (specifically 
navigating the tree from left to right, stores all of the Nodes' names in the input 
array, and returns it.

    Sample input:
          A
        / | \
       B  C  D
      / \   / \
     E   F G   H
        / \ \
       I   J K

    Sample output: ["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K"]
