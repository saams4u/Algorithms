Find Closest Value in BST -> https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Find%20Closest%20Value%20In%20BST

You are given a BST data structure consisting of BST nodes. Each BST node has an 
integer value stored in a property called "value" and two children nodes stored 
in properties called "left" and "right" respectively.

A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it satifies the BST property:

1) its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left
2) its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right
3) both of its children nodes are either BST nodes themselves or None (null) values
4) you are also given a target integer value

Write a function that finds the closest value to that target value contained 
in the BST. Assume that there will only be one closest value.

  Sample input:
        10    ,12
      /   \
      5     15
    / \   /  \
    2   5 13  22

  Sample output: 13
