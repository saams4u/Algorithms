Three Number Sum -> https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Three%20Number%20Sum

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer 
representing a target sum.

1) The function should find all triplets in the array that sum up to the target 
   sum and return a two-dimensional array of all these triplets.
2) The numbers in each triplet should be ordered in ascending order, and the 
   triplets themselves should be ordered in ascending order with respect to
   the numbers they hold.
3) If no three numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return 
   an empty array.

    Sample input: [12,3,1,2,-6,5,-8,6],0
    Sample output: [[-8,2,6],[-8,3,5],[-6,1,5]]
