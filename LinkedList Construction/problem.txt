LinkedList Construction -> https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Linked%20List%20Construction

Write a class for a Doubly Linked List. 

1) The class should have "head" and "tail" properties, both of which should point 
   to either the None (null) value or to a Linked List node 
2) Every node will have a "value" property as well as "next" and "prev" properties, 
   both of which can point to either the None (null) value or another node 
3) The class should support setting the head and tail of the linked list, inserting 
   nodes before and after other nodes as well as at certain positions, removing given 
   nodes and removing nodes with specific values, and searching for nodes with values
4) Only the searching method should return a value: specifically, a boolean

    Sample input:
    1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
    
    Sample output (after setting 4 to head):
    4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5
    Sample output (after setting 6 to tail):
    4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6
    Sample output (after setting 3 before 6):
    4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6
    Sample output (after inserting a new 3 after 6):
    4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> 3
    Sample output (after inserting a new 3 at position 1):
    3 -> 4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 6 -> 3
    Sample output (after removing nodes with value 3):
    4 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 6
    Sample output (after removing 2):
    4 -> 1 -> 5 -> 6
    Sample output (after searching for 5): True
