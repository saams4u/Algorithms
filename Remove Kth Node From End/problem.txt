Remove Kth Node From End -> https://algoexpert.io/questions/Remove%20Kth%20Node%20From%20End

Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List and an integer k and removes
the kth node from the end of the list.

Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well as a next node pointing to the next node in
the list or to None / null if it's the tail of the list.

You can assume that the input Linked List will always have at least 2 nodes and, more
specifically, at least k nodes.


    Sample Input:

    head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9
    k = 4

    Sample Output:

    0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9
