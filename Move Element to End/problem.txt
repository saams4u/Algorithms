Move Element To End -> https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Move%20Element%20To%20End

You are given an array of integers and an integer. Write a function that moves all 
instances of that integer in the array to the end of the array. The function should 
perform this in place and does not need to maintain the order of the other integers.

    Sample input: [2,1,2,2,2,3,4,2],2
    Sample output: [1,3,4,2,2,2,2,2] (the numbers 1, 3, and 4 could be ordered differently)
