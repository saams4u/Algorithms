Min Max Stack Construction -> https://algoexpert.io/questions/Min%20Max%20Stack%20Construction

Write a MinMaxStack class for a Min Max Stack. The class should suppport:

    - Pushing and popping values on and off the stack.
    - Peeking at the value at the top of the stack.
    - Getting both the minimum and maximum values in the stack at any given point in time.

All class methods, when considered independently, should run in constant time and with 
constant space.


    Sample Usage:

    MinMaxStack(): -
    push(5): -
    getMin(): 5
    getMax(): 5
    peek(): 5
    push(7): -
    getMin(): 5
    getMax(): 7
    peek(): 7
    push(2): -
    getMin(): 2
    getMax(): 7
    peek(): 2
    pop(): 2
    pop(): 7
    getMin(): 5
    getMax(): 5
    peek(): 5
