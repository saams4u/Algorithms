Suffix Trie Construction -> https://algoexpert.io/questions/Suffix%20Trie%20Construction

Write a SuffixTrie class for a Suffix-Trie-like data structure. The class should have a root
property set to be the root node of the trie and should support:

    - Creating the trie from a string; this will be done by calling the populateSuffixTrieForm
      method upon class instantiation, which should populate the root of the class.
    - Searching for strings in the trie.

Note that every string added to the trie should end with the special endSymbol character: "*"


    Sample Input (for creation):

    string = "babc"

    Sample Output (for creation):

    {
      "c": {"*": true},
      "b": {
        "c": {"*": true},
        "a": {"b": {"c": {"*": true}}},
      },
      "a": {"b": {"c": {"*": true}}},
    }

    Sample Input:

    string = "abc"

    Sample Output:

    true
