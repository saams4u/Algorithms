Depth-first Search -> https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Depth-first%20Search

You are given a Node class that has a name and an array of optional children Nodes. 
When put together, Nodes form a simple-tree-structure. Implement the depthFirstSearch 
method on the Node class, which:

1) takes in an empty array
2) traverses the tree using the Depth-first Search approach 
3) stores all of the Nodes' names in the input array, and returns it

    Sample input:
          A
        / | \
       B  C  D
      / \   / \
     E   F G   H
        / \ \
       I   J K
     
    Sample output: ["A","B","E","F","I","J","C","D","G","K","H"]
