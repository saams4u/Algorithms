Water Area -> https://algoexpert.io/questions/Water%20Area

You're given an array of non-negative integers where each non-zero integer represents the height of
a pillar of width 1. Imagine water being poured over all of the pillars; write a function that returns
the surface area of the water trapped between the pillars viewed from the front. Note that the spilled
water should be ignored.


    Sample Input:

    heights = [0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 10, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 3]

    Sample Output:
