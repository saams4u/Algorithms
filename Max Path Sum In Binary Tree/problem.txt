Max Path Sum In Binary Tree -> https://algoexpert/questions/Max%20Path%20Sum%20In%20Binary%20Tree

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns its max path sum.

A path is a collection of connected nodes in a tree where no node is connected to more than two other
nodes; a path sum is the sum of the values of the nodes in a particular path.

Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. Children nodes
can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null.


    Sample Input:

    tree =  1 
          /   \ 
         2     3
        / \   / \ 
       4   5 6   7

    Sample Output:

    18 // 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 7
