Branch Sums -> https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/Branch%20Sums

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns a list of its branch 
sums (ordered from leftmost branch sum to rightmost branch sum). 

1) a branch sum is the sum of all values in a Binary Tree branch
2) a Binary Tree branch is a path of nodes in a tree that starts at the root node 
   and ends at any leaf node
3) each Binary Tree node has a value stored in a property called "value" and 
   two-children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right", respectively

    Sample input:
           1
         /   \
        2      3
       / \    / \
      4   5  6   7
     / \   \
    8   9   10

    Sample output: [15,16,18,10,11]
